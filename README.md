# The Settlers II 10th Anniversary decrypter
decrypts and encrypts the assets of The Settlers II 10th Anniversary.

## How To Build
Have a c++ compiler installed and run `g++ decrypter.cpp -o decrypter`.
*Note: you need at least c++ 17 to be able to compile it*

## Troubleshooting
If it doesn't work for you:
1. maybe it doesn't have permission to create a file in that location; try copying what you want to decrypt to your desktop and try again.
2. try using it with cmd to see the error log.
